  - or copy [this](https://github.com/Empyreal96/Astoria-Package-Manager/raw/main/Android%20Data%20Folder.lnk.link) link to your Phone Storage, and rename from `.lnk.link` to `.lnk`

## Features:

# Help

**How do I access Android Storage? I don't have [This Phone]  > [Android Storage] folder**

- There is a Folder Shortcut in this repo, download that file and **copy to device**, rename from `Android Data Folder.lnk.link` to `Android Data Folder.lnk`. This will give direct access to the folder Astoria Package Manager requires.



### Notices:
- UI is not final 
- This is still in early stages, issues may occur
